## Introduction

Are you a student wanting to easily track your study hours and see your study pattern during the week? The Academic Study Performance Analyzer is a C++ program designed to assist second-year Software Engineering students in tracking their daily study hours leading up to final exams. By recording study hours each day, students can better organize their study schedules.

Students often record their daily study time in notebooks but struggle to summarize and analyze this data. This program allows students to input their study hours for each day of the week and generates a report showing the study hours for each day, the total weekly study hours, and the average study hours per day.

## What This Program Does

Have you ever written down your study hours in a notebook and then struggled to understand your overall study habits? This program helps you:

- Record your daily study hours: Enter how many hours you studied each day of the week.
- See your total study time: Find out how many hours you studied in total during the week.
- Know your average daily study time: See the average number of hours you studied per day.
- Find your data quickly: If there are many students using the program, you can easily search for your records by name or student ID.

This program is perfect for students preparing for exams or anyone who wants to keep track of their study habits.
## Key Features

- This Program's Files: You will also need the program's files that are hosted in this repository.

### Installing and Running the Program: Simple Instructions

1. Download the Code Files: On the GitHub page for this project, find the green button that says "Code". Click on it and choose the "Download ZIP" option. This will download all of the program's files.
2. Unzip the Files: Find the file that you downloaded, it will be called something like "study-performance-analyzer-main.zip" or similar, and extract its contents by unzipping it. You can do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Extract All".
3. Open a Terminal: Open the terminal app on your computer. This might be called Command Prompt, Command Line, Terminal, or other names depending on your system.
4. Navigate to the Project Folder: In your terminal application, type the command cd followed by the path to the folder you just extracted. For example, if you have extracted the program files into a folder called study-performance-analyzer, you would type cd path/to/study-performance-analyzer.
