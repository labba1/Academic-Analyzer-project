# Academic Study Performance Analyser 
Prepared by:SWEG Section A (2017/25)

●Are you a student wanting to easily track your study hours and see your study pattern during the week?
The Academic Study Performance Analzer is a C++ program designed to assist second-year Software Engineering student in tracking their daily study hours leading up to final exams. By recording study hours for each day of the week, students can analyze their performance with total weekly hours and average daily hours.

Students often record their daily study time in notebooks, but struggle to summarize and analyze this data in order to better organize their study schedule.
This program allows students to input their study hours for each day of the week and generates a report showing the study hours of each day, the total weekly study hours, and the average study hours per day. The program also includes a search function, allowing a student to easily find the records corresponding to his name.

■ What This Program Does?

Have you ever written down your study hours in a notebook and then struggled to understand your overall study habits? That's where this program comes in! It helps you:

•  Record your daily study hours: Enter how many hours you studied each day of the week.
•  See your total study time: Find out how many hours you studied in total during the week.
•  Know your average daily study time: See the average number of hours you studied per day.
•  Find your data quickly: If there are many students using the program, you can easily search for your records by name or student ID.

This program is perfect for students preparing for exams or anyone who wants to keep track of their study habits.

■ How It Works: The Key Features? 

Here's what this program can do:

 ● Data Storage: Utilizes parallel arrays to store:
        • Student names or IDs
        • Study hours for each day of the week (7 days)
 ● Calculations:
        • Computes total study hours for the week
        • Calculates average study hours per day

 ● Search Functionality: Enables searching for specific students by name or ID.

 ● Output: Displays results in a clear tabular format.
 ● Easy Input: You'll be prompted to enter your name (or student ID) and study hours for each day of the week.
 ● Organized Data: The program keeps track of all your data in an organized way internally.
 ● Clear Results: You'll see a nicely formatted table showing:
    •  Your study hours for each day of the week.
    •  Your total study hours for the week.
    •  The average study hours per day across all students.
    ● Searchable: You can easily search for your study data by entering your name or student ID.
    ● Handles Many Students: This program can handle data for a big class without a limit in the number of students, so you will have no problems using it with a large group of students.

■ Getting Started: How to Use This Program

■ What You Need

• A Computer: You need a computer where you can run this program.

• C++ Compiler: You will need to install a software tool called a C++ compiler that allows you to run the program. If you don't have this, don't worry, you can find installation guides on the web. You can search for *install g++* to find installation guides for the c++ compiler in your system.
• This Program's Files: You will also need the program's files that are hosted in this repository.

■ Installing and Running the Program: Simple Instructions

1. Download the Code Files:On the GitHub page for this project, find the green button that says "Code". Click on it and choose the "Download ZIP" option. This will download all of the program's files to your computer.
2. Unzip the Files:Find the file that you downloaded, it will be called something like "study-performance-analyzer-main.zip" or similar, and extract its content by unzipping it. You can do this by double-clicking on the file and choosing the option to extract the files or if that does not work you can right click on the file, choose the option to extract, and then choose the location where the content of the zip file will be extracted. This will extract the files to a folder with the same name.
3. Open a Terminal: Open the terminal app in your computer. This might be called command prompt, command line, terminal or other names depending on the system that you use.
4. Navigate to the Project Folder:In your terminal application, type the command `cd` followed by the path to the folder you just extracted. For example, if you have extracted the program files in a folder called "study-performance-analyzer-main" inside your download folder, you can use the following command:
   
■ How to Use the Program

Once the program is running, it will ask you for some information:

1. Number of Students: The program will first ask for the number of students you are tracking the information for.
2. Student Data: For each student, the program will ask for the student name or ID, and the number of hours they studied for each day of the week (from Day 1 to Day 7).
3. Results Table: After you've entered all the student information, the program will show you a table with your data organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and see the overall weekly performance.
4. Search Data: After all the data has been entered, you can search for a particular student using their name or student ID.

■ Using the Program: Step-by-Step

1. Enter the Number of Students: When the program starts, it will first ask you how many students you want to track the data for.
2. Enter Each Student's Data:
  •  The program will then ask for the name or student ID of each student.
  •  After that, it will ask for the study hours for each day of the week (Day 1 to Day 7) for each student.
3. See the Results Table: Once you’ve entered all the information, the program will display a table with all the data you entered, the total weekly study time for each student and the overall daily average.
4. Search for a Student The program will ask if you would like to search for the data of a particular student. If you answer yes, you will be prompted to enter the name or ID of the student that you want to see the data for.
