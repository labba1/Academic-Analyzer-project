Prepared by:SWEG Section A (2017/25)

A C++ program designed to help students track and analyze their daily study hours, providing insights into their weekly performance:-
The Academic Study Performance Analyzer is a C++ application developed to assist students in tracking their daily study hours and to analyze their study pattern during the week. Students often record their daily study time in notebooks, but struggle to summarize and analyze this data in order to better organize their study schedule.
This program allows students to input their study hours for each day of the week and generates a report showing the study hours of each day, the total weekly study hours, and the average study hours per day. The program also includes a search function, allowing a student to easily find the records corresponding to his name.
